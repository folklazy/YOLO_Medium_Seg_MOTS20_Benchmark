# Medium result interfaces

The uppercase canonical CSVs are normalized only after all three accuracy results and clean timing are complete. Source measurements remain under the immutable run directory and `timing/<run_id>/clean_repetition/`. CSV precision is preserved. [Common data schema](https://github.com/folklazy/YOLO_Instance_Segmentation_MOTS20_Scaling_Study/blob/main/DATA_SCHEMA.md) defines columns and units.

Per-frame/per-instance evidence stays local and is not blindly published. Overall AP is the frozen pooled evaluator output, not a mean of sequence AP. Reserved VRAM, baselines, load times and complete timing statistics remain in source summaries; the canonical schema exposes allocated peak. Recovery does not recompute completed model metrics. Provenance records reused, continued and new work.
